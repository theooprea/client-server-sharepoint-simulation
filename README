Clent-Server File Service - Sharepoint Simulation

A client server application throguh TCP that simulates the HTTP protocol. The
client can login to an account that is hardcoded in the server and perform a
series of HTTP requests to the server:

- login <user> <password> - attempts to login and get acces to the files
- GET <filename> - gets the <filename> file from the server (if any is found)
and make a local copy of it
- PUT <filename> <content> - saves a file with the name <filename> and content
<content> on the server side
- DELETE <filename> - deletes the <filename> file from the server side, if such
file is found
- quit - disconnect the user from the server

The server acts similarly to a sharepoint, all users having access to all files
but only some authorized users having access to modify the contents of the
sharepoint.
